            <p class="p"> Hey there,  you can call me <b>NATE</b>.  Ignore that big name up top. I am a <mark>US Army Veteran</mark> and a computer enthusiast. I have been to schools for Communication, Networking, Audio Engineering, and Audio Production.  Now I am attending Coding courses to broaden my computer versatality.
                    I grew up in Oklahoma and now I have returned there and currently reside there.  I would like to see if that changes and where life takes me and my family though.  Thanks for reading :)

        <P class="q">I look forward to chasing more depth of knowledge in understanding of computer systems,  I have always loved working around electronics and smart products but to understand how they actually function internal and behind the written code is something I am currently excited to absorb.</P>
